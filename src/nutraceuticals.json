A change in this metabolism can lead to serious physiological dysfunctions, leading to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

Glucose comes from food and is stored in the body in the form of glycogen (in the muscles and liver) or circulating glucose (in the blood). Cells need the hormone Insulin to capture glucose molecules. The glucose / insulin balance in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of the body's whole  metabolism. A change in this metabolism can lead to serious physiological dysfunctions, leading to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. There are several classes of compounds that influence this metabolism, these can increase insulin synthesis and secretion, decrease blood glucose levels, reduce the immediate absorption of carbohydrates, regulate the sensitivity of cells to insulin, among others.",

Glucose comes from food and is stored in the body in the form of glycogen (in the muscles and liver) or circulating glucose (in the blood). Cells need the hormone Insulin to capture glucose molecules. The glucose / insulin balance in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of the body's whole  metabolism. A change in this metabolism can lead to serious physiological dysfunctions, leading to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. There are several classes of compounds that influence this metabolism, these can increase insulin synthesis and secretion, decrease blood glucose levels, reduce the immediate absorption of carbohydrates, regulate the sensitivity of cells to insulin, among others.",

PMS is a very common condition. Its symptoms affect more than 90 percent of menstruating women. It must impair some aspect of your life for your doctor to diagnose you. PMS symptoms start five to 11 days before menstruation and typically go away once menstruation begins. The cause of PMS is unknown. However, many researchers believe that it’s related to a change in both sex hormone and serotonin levels at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase during certain times of the month. An increase in these hormones can cause mood swings, anxiety, and irritability. Ovarian steroids also modulate activity in parts of your brain associated with premenstrual symptoms.",

Glucose comes from food and is stored in the body in the form of glycogen (in the muscles and liver) or circulating glucose (in the blood). Cells need the hormone Insulin to capture glucose molecules. The glucose / insulin balance in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of the body's whole  metabolism. A change in this metabolism can lead to serious physiological dysfunctions, leading to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. There are several classes of compounds that influence this metabolism, these can increase insulin synthesis and secretion, decrease blood glucose levels, reduce the immediate absorption of carbohydrates, regulate the sensitivity of cells to insulin, among others.",

A change in this metabolism can lead to serious physiological dysfunctions, leading to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

This plant is a small palm tree native to North America and its extracts are used medicinally as an antiandrogen and antiedematous. The saw palmetto supplement has a caloric value, as it is a mixture of fatty acids. The fatty acids found in the fruit have the ability to block an enzyme that converts the hormone testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the most androgenic form), which can cause hair loss. Saw palmetto supplementation has also been used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and urinary tract symptoms.</p>\n",

PMS is a very common condition. Its symptoms affect more than 90 percent of menstruating women. It must impair some aspect of your life for your doctor to diagnose you. PMS symptoms start five to 11 days before menstruation and typically go away once menstruation begins. The cause of PMS is unknown. However, many researchers believe that it’s related to a change in both sex hormone and serotonin levels at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase during certain times of the month. An increase in these hormones can cause mood swings, anxiety, and irritability. Ovarian steroids also modulate activity in parts of your brain associated with premenstrual symptoms.",
